# Unimate - Progress Report

## ‚úÖ What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- **Django Backend:** Fully operational with REST API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL configured with all models
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens working correctly
- **WebSocket:** Real-time communication via Django Channels
- **CORS:** Properly configured for cross-origin requests

### RFID Integration
- **ESP32 Scanner:** Successfully connects to backend
- **Card Reading:** Detects and transmits card IDs
- **API Endpoint:** `/api/scan/` processes card data
- **Test Cards:** 3 valid cards configured (5A653600, 04B5C6D7E8, 0499AA11BB)
- **Test Mode:** Automatic card simulation for development

### User Interface
- **Login Page:** RFID card authentication
- **Dashboard:** Authenticated user view with timetable
- **3D Map:** Full-featured campus visualization
- **Building Navigation:** Manual building selection works
- **Route Calculation:** Distance and walking time displayed

### 3D Visualization Features
- **9 Campus Buildings:** All rendered with unique designs
- **Interactive Selection:** Click buildings to navigate
- **Route Display:** Visual path with start/end markers
- **Camera Controls:** Drag to rotate view
- **Decorations:** Trees, benches, roads for realism

### Data Management
- **User Profiles:** Created with RFID mappings
- **Timetable Events:** Classes, exams, appointments
- **Room Information:** Building and room numbers
- **Test Data:** Comprehensive dataset for development

## üêõ Known Issues

### Minor Bugs
- WebSocket reconnection sometimes fails
- Some inline styles should be in CSS
- Error messages not always user-friendly
- Camera position resets on window resize

### Performance Issues
- Initial 3D map load could be faster
- Large timetables cause slight lag
- Memory usage increases over time
- WebSocket messages not optimized

### UX Issues
- No loading indicators during API calls
- Limited keyboard navigation support
- Touch controls need improvement
- Small click targets on mobile

## üìä Project Statistics

### Codebase
- **Backend:** ~2,500 lines of Python
- **Frontend:** ~1,500 lines of JavaScript
- **Styles:** ~800 lines of CSS
- **Hardware:** ~300 lines of C++ (ESP32)

### Features Completed- **Authentication:** 100%- **Basic Navigation:** 100%- **3D Visualization:** 90%- **Timetable Display:** 100%- **Class Navigation:** 30% (in progress - Task 1.3 complete)

### Test Coverage
- **Backend API:** Good coverage with test scripts
- **Frontend:** Manual testing + component tests
- **Hardware:** Standalone test server created
- **Integration:** End-to-end flow tested

## üéØ Next Milestones
